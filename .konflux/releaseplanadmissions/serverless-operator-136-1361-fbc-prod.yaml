        The Red Hat OpenShift Serverless Operator provides a collection of APIs that
        enables containers, microservices and functions to run "serverless".
        Serverless applications can scale up and down (to zero) on demand and be triggered by a
        number of event sources. OpenShift Serverless integrates with a number of
        platform services, such as Monitoring and it is based on the open
        source project Knative.
