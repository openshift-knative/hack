    solution: |
      The Red Hat OpenShift Serverless Operator provides a collection of APIs that
      enables containers, microservices and functions to run "serverless".
      Serverless applications can scale up and down (to zero) on demand and be triggered by a
      number of event sources. OpenShift Serverless integrates with a number of
      platform services, such as Monitoring and it is based on the open
      source project Knative.
