        The Red Hat OpenShift Serverless Operator provides a collection of APIs that
        enables containers, microservices and functions to run "serverless".
        Serverless applications can scale up and down (to zero) on demand and be triggered by a
        number of event sources. OpenShift Serverless integrates with a number of
        platform services, such as Monitoring and it is based on the open
        source project Knative.

      # This causes the release pipeline to not upload layer size information
      # to pyxis which will save on runtime at the cost of data completeness in
      # pyxis. The side-effects are:
      # * If you are a base image, like ubi9, then partners cannot certify that they build on top of you.
      # * Size information is not displayed in the catalog. This is very low business impact.
